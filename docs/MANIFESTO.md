On the violent consequence of democratic decisions.

It is true that most of, if not all, the alternatives to democracy are worse.
People should have a voice in how their lives are affected by policies. With it,
the ideals of freedom, representation, and fairness are promised.

However, there are countless examples from history and the present on how
dictators have risen to power not with bullets, but with ballots.
**Adolf Hitler**'s rise in Germany and **António de Oliveira Salazar**'s tenure
in Portugal serve as stark reminders of how democratic processes can be
manipulated to establish authoritarian regimes.

If the same system that promises to guarantee freedom can also destroy it, what
can we do to prevent it? I propose that the answer lies in **education**. This
is our most potent tool against ignorance and propaganda, which often fuel
populist movements.

It's no coincidence that newly established dictatorships frequently target
educational institutions and the educated classes. By undermining education,
they aim to suppress critical thinking and consolidate control. Only force can
be used to control those who are immune to propaganda.

Democracy remains our best option, but it requires vigilance and continuous
improvement. Without proactive measures, we risk perpetuating a cycle where
periods of enlightenment are followed by regression into authoritarianism.

We must not let ourselves believe that we've nailed democracy and that we can
no longer make it better, even if better is not obvious at first.

## What Makes us Human?

We don't usually refer to ourselves as _Homo sapiens_. Unless we're in a
taxonomy class, that is. Instead, we call ourselves humans.

Most dictionaries define human as _"a person, in contrast to an animal or
machine."_ Essentially, we're _Homo sapiens_ — an animal — with something more.
That _"something"_ is our **humanity**.

But what is our humanity? We like to believe we're special among living beings.
We use complex language to express abstract ideas and collaborate. We create
art, follow rituals, and uphold traditions. We possess a moral compass guiding
our social interactions. We've evolved to live in societies, becoming less
reactive and more tolerant. We build upon past knowledge and culture, passing it
on to future generations.

It's our capacity to care for others — not just those close to us, but also
strangers — that defines us. We strive for survival, not only our own but that
of our society. We want our children to thrive. By ensuring everyone can
survive, we all contribute to society's well-being. Only when our personal
survival is threatened do we consider sacrificing societal well-being.
Self-preservation is ingrained in our animal nature. The only way to keep it in
check is through a well-functioning, supportive society.
