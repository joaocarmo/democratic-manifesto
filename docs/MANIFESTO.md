It is true that most of, if not all, the alternatives to democracy are worse.
People should have a voice in how their lives are affected by policies. With it,
the ideals of freedom, representation, and fairness are promised.

However, there are countless examples from history and the present on how
dictators have risen to power not with bullets, but with ballots.
**Adolf Hitler**'s rise in Germany and **António de Oliveira Salazar**'s tenure
in Portugal serve as stark reminders of how democratic processes can be
manipulated to establish authoritarian regimes.

If the same system that promises to guarantee freedom can also destroy it, what
can we do to prevent it? I propose that the answer lies in **education**. This
is our most potent tool against ignorance and propaganda, which often fuel
populist movements.

It's no coincidence that newly established dictatorships frequently target
educational institutions and the educated classes. By undermining education,
they aim to suppress critical thinking and consolidate control. Only force can
be used to control those who are immune to propaganda.

Democracy remains our best option, but it requires vigilance and continuous
improvement. Without proactive measures, we risk perpetuating a cycle where
periods of enlightenment are followed by regression into authoritarianism.

We must not let ourselves believe that we've nailed democracy and that we can
no longer make it better; even if better is not obvious at first.
