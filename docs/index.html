                  Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in
                  this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is
                  perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is
                  the worst form of Government except for all those other forms
                  that have been tried from time to time...

          <p>
            It is true that most of, if not all, the alternatives to democracy
            are worse. People should have a voice in how their lives are
            affected by policies. With it, the ideals of freedom,
            representation, and fairness are promised.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there are countless examples from history and the present
            on how dictators have risen to power not with bullets, but with
            ballots. <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>'s rise in Germany and
            <strong>António de Oliveira Salazar</strong>'s tenure in Portugal
            serve as stark reminders of how democratic processes can be
            manipulated to establish authoritarian regimes.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the same system that promises to guarantee freedom can also
            destroy it, what can we do to prevent it? I propose that the answer
            lies in
            <strong>education</strong>. This is our most potent tool against
            ignorance and propaganda, which often fuel populist movements.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's no coincidence that newly established dictatorships frequently
            target educational institutions and the educated classes. By
            undermining education, they aim to suppress critical thinking and
            consolidate control. Only force can be used to control those who are
            immune to propaganda.
          </p>

          <p>
            Democracy remains our best option, but it requires vigilance and
            continuous improvement. Without proactive measures, we risk
            perpetuating a cycle where periods of enlightenment are followed by
            regression into authoritarianism.
          </p>

          <p>
            We must not let ourselves believe that we've nailed democracy and
            that we can no longer make it better; even if better is not obvious
            at first.
