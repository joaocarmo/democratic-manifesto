                  Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in
                  this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is
                  perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is
                  the worst form of Government except for all those other forms
                  that have been tried from time to time...

          <p>
            It is true that most of, if not all, the alternatives to democracy
            are worse. People should have a voice in how their lives are
            affected by policies. With it, the ideals of freedom,
            representation, and fairness are promised.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there are countless examples from history and the present
            on how dictators have risen to power not with bullets, but with
            ballots. <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>'s rise in Germany and
            <strong>António de Oliveira Salazar</strong>'s tenure in Portugal
            serve as stark reminders of how democratic processes can be
            manipulated to establish authoritarian regimes.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the same system that promises to guarantee freedom can also
            destroy it, what can we do to prevent it? I propose that the answer
            lies in
            <strong>education</strong>. This is our most potent tool against
            ignorance and propaganda, which often fuel populist movements.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's no coincidence that newly established dictatorships frequently
            target educational institutions and the educated classes. By
            undermining education, they aim to suppress critical thinking and
            consolidate control. Only force can be used to control those who are
            immune to propaganda.
          </p>

          <p>
            Democracy remains our best option, but it requires vigilance and
            continuous improvement. Without proactive measures, we risk
            perpetuating a cycle where periods of enlightenment are followed by
            regression into authoritarianism.
          </p>

          <p>
            We must not let ourselves believe that we've nailed democracy and
            that we can no longer make it better, even if better is not obvious
            at first.

          <h2>What Makes us Human?</h2>

          <p>
            We don't usually refer to ourselves as <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Unless
            we're in a taxonomy class, that is. Instead, we call ourselves
            humans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most dictionaries define human as
            <em>"a person, in contrast to an animal or machine."</em>
            Essentially, we're <em>Homo sapiens</em> — an animal — with
            something more. That <em>"something"</em> is our
            <strong>humanity</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            But what is our humanity? We like to believe we're special among
            living beings. We use complex language to express abstract ideas and
            collaborate. We create art, follow rituals, and uphold traditions.
            We possess a moral compass guiding our social interactions. We've
            evolved to live in societies, becoming less reactive and more
            tolerant. We build upon past knowledge and culture, passing it on to
            future generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's our capacity to care for others — not just those close to us,
            but also strangers — that defines us. We strive for survival, not
            only our own but that of our society. We want our children to
            thrive. By ensuring everyone can survive, we all contribute to
            society's well-being. Only when our personal survival is threatened
            do we consider sacrificing societal well-being. Self-preservation is
            ingrained in our animal nature. The only way to keep it in check is
            through a well-functioning, supportive society.
